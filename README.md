# LMS Frontend Application - README
This README file provides instructions on how to set up and run the LMS Frontend application, a React application that serves as the user interface for a Learning Management System.

# Prerequisites
## Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/en
## Setting Up the Project
## Clone the Repository:

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Use the following command to clone the repository from 

GitHub:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lms-frontend.git
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash
cd lms-frontend
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.
content_copy
(Alternatively, with yarn: yarn install)

Run the Development Server:

Start the development server to run the application locally:

Bash
npm start
Use code with caution.
content_copy
(Alternatively, with yarn: yarn start)

This will start the server and open the application in your default web browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
The application provides a basic dashboard interface for an LMS system. You can navigate through different components and see functionalities like:

Header: Displays application logo and user information (name and optional profile picture).
Welcome: Shows a greeting message with the user's name.
Search Bar: Allows users to search for specific courses. Matching text within course names is highlighted for better visibility.
Progress: Displays the student's progress information (percentage and calendar view) (if implemented).
Course List: Lists enrolled courses with details like name, teacher, and progress. Highlighted courses indicate matches based on the search term.
Course Details: Shows details of a specific course when selected from the list (if implemented).
Note: The specific functionalities might vary depending on the features implemented in the application.

Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository on GitHub and submit pull requests with your changes.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
